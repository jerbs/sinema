                  A Media Player and TV Viewer	



Sinema is a free, GPL licensed media player and TV application.

FFmpeg is used for video and audio decoding. Sinema can play every
format supported by the installed FFmpeg library.

ALSA is used to access the sound card. Accessing ALSA directly is
possible from a single application only. Usually this is not wanted.
It can be avoided by using Pulse Audio with a virtual ALSA device.
Using Pulse Audio directly is not supported.

XVideo is the only supported video output interface.

TV viewing is only supported with analog TV cards having an
MPEG hardware encoder. It is expected, that the encoded MPEG data is
available at /dev/video0. The command "cp /dev/video0 tv.mpg" should
produce a valid MPEG file. Otherwise watching TV will not be possible
with Sinema. Watching TV is tested with the IVTV driver. See
<http://ivtvdriver.org> for details about supported TV cards.

The time shifting implementation is still very basic. Live TV is
written to /tmp/tv.mpg and simultaneously that file is played. The
file name is hard-coded. During a TV session that file isn't truncated.
Ensure that the partition at /tmp provides enough free space.

Cropping the video picture is possible to avoid black borders. Some
cropping areas are predefined and can be enabled via the View menu.
Alternatively the cropping area can intuitively be selected using the
mouse. Move the mouse pointer to the edges and press the right mouse
button. The shape of the mouse pointer indicates the action. Pressing
the right mouse button, when the mouse is placed in the middle of the
video picture, undoes any cropping.

Pressing the middle mouse button shows and hides an additional control
window. Pressing the right mouse button opens a context menu with the
most important items also available in the main menu. This is especially
useful for the full screen mode.
