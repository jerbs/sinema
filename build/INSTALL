Installing Sinema with own FFmpeg version
=========================================

The FFmpeg API isn't very stable. From time to time functions are deprecated
and finally removed. To be more flexible in these cases the Makefile in the
build directory supports to build a specific and probably (i.e. currently)
patched FFmpeg version together with sinema. By default everything is installed
into a directory called 'root' within the top level source code directory of
sinema. Both FFmpeg and sinema are built and installed by simply executing:

$ cd build
$ make install

The sinema executable and the FFmpeg libraries are installed into the
directory ..../sinema/root/bin and .../sinema/root/lib.

Installing into another directory is possible by explicitly setting PREFIX.
You also may want to execute the install steps with root permissions:

$ cd build
$ make PREFIX=/usr/local ffmpeg_make
$ sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local ffmpeg_install
$ make PREFIX=/usr/local sinema_make
$ sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local sinema_install
