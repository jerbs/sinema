Installing Sinema
=================

Sinema depends on the FFmpeg library to decode audio and video files. Since
the FFmpeg library is changing its API frequently, a FFmpeg version that is
known to work is configured as submodule. That subrepository may even contain
some FFmpeg patches.

Read build/INSTALL about how to build that FFmpeg version and Sinema on top
of it.

Sinema itself is using the GNU autotools build system. The build steps are:

  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Now it is possible to start Sinema:

  sinema
