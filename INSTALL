Installing Sinema
=================

The GNU autotools build system is used.

If you have cloned the git repository then bootstrapping is the first step:

  ./bootstrap

If you are using a distribution file, then this step is already done and
you can start with calling the configure script:

  ./configure

Sinema extensively uses Boost. It depends on Boost 1.42. If your system
has installed an older Boost version, you first have to upgrade your.
Boost is available at http://www.boost.org. The "Getting Started" section
contains a description about how to install Boost. By default the Boost
library is installed under /usr/local and you will have to parallel Boost
installations on your system. The used m4 script does not properly handle
this situation and needs some assistance:

  ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/ --with-boost-libdir=/usr/local/lib/

Without using the additional options the build will still work, but the
runtime linker will use the wrong shared libraries. On my system this 
resulted in a segmentation fault when terminating Sinema.

The next step is to compile and link the the application:

  make

The source code uses features of the new upcoming C++ standard C++10.
Sinema is tested with gcc 4.4.3. With older versions compilation may fail.

For installing the application you must have the necessary permissions.
Usually root access is required:

  sudo make install

Now it is possible to start Sinema:

  sinema
